# Classic Game Builders: Codex Edition

This repository contains classic computer games implemented by GitHub Copilot / OpenAI Codex as part of a research initiative to evaluate AI code generation capabilities.

## ü§ñ Agent: Codex / Copilot

All code in this repository was authored by the Codex model family (via GitHub Copilot), using prompt-based instructions and architectural guidance. No human coding was involved unless explicitly noted in the commit log.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository represents one arm of a larger experimental framework. It is used to:

- Evaluate how Codex handles game construction from scratch
- Examine modularity, clarity, and logic correctness
- Test Codex‚Äôs ability to follow structured design prompts
- Compare its output against other AI code agents like Cursor and Jules

## üîç Repository Status

- **View-Only**: This repository is published for review and educational analysis only. External pull requests, issues, or contributions will not be accepted.
- **License**: MIT License

## üß± Core Components

Each game is built using a modular architecture including:

- **Game Logic Engine**
- **User Interface**
- **AI Agent Hook (optional)**
- **Logging System (JSON + human-readable)**
- **Dashboard Integration (shared across repos)**

See the main project overview for methodology, logs, and inter-agent comparisons.

## üß† Project Collaboration

This project was conceived, scoped, and architected by **Mark1999**, with strategic support and iterative design assistance provided by **Moira**‚Äîa customized instance of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Moira contributed to:

- Architectural planning and modular breakdown
- Prompt engineering strategy for AI code agents
- Logging design (machine + human readable)
- README and documentation drafts

Moira did not write game code. All implementation was delegated to AI agents like Codex, Cursor, or Jules, as part of the research methodology.
